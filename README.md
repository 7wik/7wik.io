## An introduction about me and my work

Hi! I'm Satwik

I completed my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from IIT BHU Varanasi. After that I have worked as a Research Assistant for a year at IIT-Hyderabad. I am currently working as a **Senior Associate** in CT-Tech Practice(work equivalent to an ML engineer) at **EY**. 

I'm an ML enthusiast. Working on multiple areas in the broad spectrum of ML and it's related areas like Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Deep learning, during my B-Tech and the later years, nurtured this enthusiasm of mine.

- [Prof Lakshmanan Kailasam](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/lakshmanankcse)
- [Sanjeev sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjeevsharmaiitr/) 
mentored me during my quest for _exploring_ the multiple fascets of the broad field of ML and _exploiting_ the experience by working on interesting research problems.   

This blog is particularly intended to convey what I've learned in ML through  my experiences, also I will try too discuss some of the research problems that I had worked on in the past- I started-off with pretty naive problems but as I started gaining experience, the level of complexity in the problems I dealt with also increased.
