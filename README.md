## An introduction about me and my work

Hi! I'm Satwik

I completed my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from IIT BHU Varanasi. After that I have worked as a Research Assistant for a year at IIT-Hyderabad. I am currently working as a **Senior Associate** in CT-Tech Practice(work equivalent to a ML engineer) at **EY**. 

I'm an ML enthusiast. Working on multiple areas in the broad spectrum of ML and it's related areas like Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision, Deep learning, during my B-Tech and the later years, nurtured this enthusiasm of mine.

mentored me during my quest for _exploring_ the multiple fascets of the broad field of ML and _exploiting_ the experience by working on interesting research problems.
